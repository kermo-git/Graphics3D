# Graphics3D

This project implements ray tracing and ray marching algorithms to render simple geometric shapes like spheres, cylinders, boxes and cones. To use it, you first need to create a Scene object and then add objects and light sources(see Scenes.scala). Then you can render it via Scene.render method, which takes a function setPixelColor(Int, Int, Color) as a parameter. This function is called for every pixel in the image and it receives pixel coordinates and a Color object as parameters. An example of displaying the image in a new window is given in Display.scala, which contains the main function.
